# First_SQL_Project
In this repo, i show my work on my first sql projects. My idea is to save the data from the internships GPR1, GPR2 and FPR 1 for each internship in a sql data base.
The interships are made during my bachelor of science in physics at the Humboldt-University of Berlin. The data are measurements I made in the internships and I wrote them into my lab book.


GPR: Grundpraktikum


FPR: fortgeschrittenen Praktikum
